Inkers is offering an external internship program where they teach the way neural networks work and based on the assignment solutions and surprise quiz, students would be taken into the internship offered by them.

This repository contains the materials and solutions to the assignment given for each session. 

A brief overview of the sessions are as follows:
1.  **Session 1** - Basically the first class of the 6 sessions. Introduction to convolution operation, maxpooling, different                     use cases of deep learning.
2.  **Session 2** - It's an important session. In this session, topics such as similarity between algorithmic filters like                         gabor filter and filters learned by the network were discussed. Most importantly, backpropagation                             algorithmic was discussed for simple linear regression.
3.  **Session 3** - In Depth overview of convolution operation, different types of convolutions, dropouts, different                               architectural considerations for building a CNN were discussed.
4.  **Session 4** - More of a practical session on keras. Sequential and functional API of keras were discussed. Understand                       the writing of simple Deep Neural Network Code. Also discussed about DenseNet Architecture.
5.  **Session 5** - Session 5 and Session 6 are on advanced topics. There's no material on Session 5. Session 5 is combined                       with Session 6 material. This session discussed on YOLO and SSD algorithm for object recognition.
6.  **Session 6** - This session discussed on YOLO v2 and how to implement YOLO v2 by transfer learning.

Description for Assignments can be found out from Session files.
**All the Solutions for the assignments are my own.**

In Order to run the ipython notebooks

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Use a google gmail account for google Colab, refer this link - [How to setup Google Colab](https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d
3. Upload the notebooks to your google drive account
4. Double click on the notebooks, it automatically opens in colab or you have forgotten to add Colab as of one apps accessible    to your drive.

Some of the Assignment Solutions take 8-10 hrs to run on the GPU. So, wait patiently. Also models with highest accuracy with the given number of epochs will be stored.
