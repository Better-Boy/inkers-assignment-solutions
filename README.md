Inkers is offering an external internship program where they teach the way neural networks work and based on the assignment solutions and surprise quiz, students would be taken into the internship offered by them.

This repository contains the materials and solutions to the assignment given for each session. 

A brief overview of the sessions are as follows:
1.  Session 1 - Basically the first class of the 6 sessions. Introduction to convolution operation, maxpooling, different use                 cases of deep learning.
2.  Session 2 - It's an important session. In this session, topics such as similarity between algorithmic filters like gabor                   filter and filters learned by the network were discussed. Most importantly, backpropagation algorithmic was                   discussed for simple linear regression.
3.  Session 3 - In Depth overview of convolution operation, different types of convolutions, dropouts, different architectural                 considerations for building a CNN were discussed.
4.  Session 4 - More of a practical session on keras. Sequential and functional API of keras were discussed. Understand the                   writing of simple Deep Neural Network Code. Also discussed about DenseNet Architecture.
5.  Session 5 - Session 5 and Session 6 are on advanced topics. There's no material on Session 5. Session 5 is combined with                   Session 6 material. This session discussed on YOLO and SSD algorithm for object recognition.
6.  Session 6 - This session discussed on YOLO v2 and how to implement YOLO v2 by transfer learning.

Description for Assignments can be found out from Session files.
